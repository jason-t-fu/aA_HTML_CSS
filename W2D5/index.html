      <p>Let's get some cat pictures on the screen. Create a new div with class 'image-1-container' and give it a fixed width of
      200px and a fixed height of 600px. Also give it a colored background so we can actually see it (you get to pick the
      color this time). Inside of this new div, create an img tag that points to the file called cat.jpg that's in the assets
      folder.
      Note that the image spills out of the div. By default, images will want to render with the full glorious dimensions.
      How can we combat this brash egotism? Tell the image to obey the constraints of its container by giving it a width of
      100%. NB: You may be wondering, "100% of what". From the results of this experiment, you should be able to infer that
      width percentages are determined by the width of one's parent.</p>
